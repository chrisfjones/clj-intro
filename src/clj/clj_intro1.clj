; 1. I've been working with clojure for a few years on small/medium size projects
; 2. I'll draw a lot of comparisons with Java, but I don't mean to put it down
; 3. "Clojure asks you to step up your game, and rewards you for doing so" - Stuart Halloway
; 4. I struggled a bit with the flow of this material. There are several concepts that all fit together to form the whole, but there is no clear sequence.


; 1. Live coding
(+ 1 1)


; 2. Java interop
(System/currentTimeMillis)

(org.apache.commons.math3.util.ArithmeticUtils/addAndCheck 1 1)

; 3. Data as Code



; 4. Code as Data
;   - fn as data
;   - talk about macro, maybe a little code



; 5. Immutability




; 6. atoms/refs




; sidebar - efficiency, show pic of node tree for clj list impl



; 7. high-order functions - map/reduce/filter




; 8. threading macros




; 9. concurrency

;   - change map to pmap
;   - future/promise
;   - core.async
;    - go block
;    - channel
